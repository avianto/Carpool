# Carpool

 Carpool is an open source, multi-mount, minivan PCB compaatible keyboard case.

 Carpool is designed to be used in the following ways:
 Coriander Plate: Top Mount
 Hull Plate: Top Mount
 Hull Plate: Bottom Mount
 Custom 'Leafspring Plate': Sandwich Mount

 Carpool features a 2 piece case design, optional 5deg angle, cutout for a small battery(Airport Shuttle PCB support) and is compatible with all minivan or minivan inspired pcbs that fit within the approximately 243mmx76mm pcb size.

 Carpool uses the following screws to piece it all together:
 Bottom case to top case: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller - 8-11mm (4x)
 Hull bottom mount plate: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller -  6-8mm (4x)
 hull top mount plate: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller - 6-8mm (4x)
 Coriander top mount plate: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller - 4-6mm (4x)
 Bottom case to separate angle: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller (pan or button head will fit better here due to limited material in bottom case) - 4mm (4x)

 
 Please note that the 'Leafspring plate' is mostly untested, so your mileage may vary.
