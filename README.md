Carpool is designed to be used in the following ways:
 
* Coriander Plate: Top Mount
* Hull Plate: Top Mount
* Hull Plate: Bottom Mount
* Custom 'Leafspring Plates': Sandwich Mount

Carpool features a 2 piece case design, optional 5deg angle, cutout for a small battery(Airport Shuttle PCB support) and is compatible with all minivan or minivan inspired pcbs that fit within the approximately 243mmx76mm pcb size(except Sketch).

With optional 5deg angle, front height is 22.3mm. Without, it is 21mm.
*Note that the 3DP version is 1mm taller in order to prevent a super thin bottom piece*

Bottom case is provided with both angle attached(using 3 less screws) and detached(for easier 3D printing). Bottom is designed for 19mm cork bumpons (like these https://www.amazon.com/Rockler-Self-Adhesive-Cork-Dots/dp/B001GH7JXW). You also have the option to reverse the separate Angle piece to acheive a -5deg angle.

Carpool uses the following screws to piece it all together: 
 * Bottom case to top case: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller - 8-11mm (4x)
 * Hull bottom mount plate: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller -  6-8mm (4x)
 * Hull top mount plate: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller - 6-8mm (4x)
 * Coriander top mount plate: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller - 4-6mm (4x)
 * Bottom case to separate angle: m2.5 - sockethead or smaller (pan or button head will fit better here due to limited material in bottom case) - 4mm (4x)

 
*Please note that the 'Leafspring plates' are only partially tested, so your mileage may vary.  It is important to note that extremely flexible materials like IMA may not be suitable to this case.
